# Isochrone maps
In this repo, I will show you how to create interactive and static isochrone maps in R using `openrouteservice`, `leaflet`, and `ggplot2`.
You will learn how to:

- Use the openrouteservice API to fetch isochrones for different modes of transportation and durations.
- Plot the isochrones on an interactive leaflet map with custom styles.
- Create a static ggplot map with isochrones.
